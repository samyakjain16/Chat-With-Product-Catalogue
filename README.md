# Chat-With-Product-Catalogue

## Goal

The goal of the project is to enhance store sales by providing an AI-powered platform that seamlessly connects with a storeâ€™s database, enabling the creation of custom chatbots. These chatbots allow customers to interact with the product catalog in natural language. Powered by an LLM, the system generates personalized responses, including product suggestions, matching recommendations, and pairing options, improving the shopping experience and driving conversions
